# PyDAP
Opensource tool for Computer Vision based quantification of Dose Area Product in Medical Physics applications

## What is PyDAP?

PyDAP (Python Dose Area Product) was originally developed as a master's research project intended to demonstrate a proof-of-concept method for X-ray beam area measurement in clinical settings.


## What does PyDAP do?

PyDAP applies computer vision methods to images of phosphorescent scintillation material, exposed to x-rays, in order to extract the area and dimensions of the exposed region of material.
After extraction of this information it then applies a mask to the original image which displays the area and dimensions of the beam. Note that there is an almost 1:1 correlation between x-ray beam
area and the area of phosphorescing scintillation material. 

## Who is PyDAP for?

It is primarily intended for use by medical physiscists and radiologists, but may also be useful for anyone trying to measure the area of a green region; as this is essentially what PyDAP does.

## How can you get started?

I am still in the process of writing a readme so this has yet to be determined. 

## Where can users get help with the project?

Help with project may be found in the Wiki page of this repository.
